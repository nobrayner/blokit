# Blokit

I've gotten sick and tired of forgetting things that I needed to do, and want to make a slightly better "gamefied" block counter while using the [Blocks productivity method](https://davidcain.gumroad.com/l/howtodothings)

Also seems like a fun way to mess around with Kotlin and Android dev
